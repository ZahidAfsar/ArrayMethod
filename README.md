### High-Order Array Methods
    What are High order methods? They are Methods that take in another Function/Method as a parameter.

### High-Order Array Methods we will be covering.

    1. forEach() - this method executes a function for each provided element in the array

    2. filter() - this method creates a new array with each element that passes the test function

    3. map() - Calls a defined callback function on each element of an array, and returns an array that contains the results.

    4. findIndex() - Returns the index of the first element that meets the condition of the callback function.

    5. every() - this methods tests every element in our array and if all pass our function condition it returns true

### High-Order Methods vs Forloops

        1. Readability the syntax makes the code more readable

        2. Allows the developer to clearly state their intent.

        3. Each Method is designed for a specific task

        4. Reduces chance of errors (specifically off by 1 Errors);

### Chaining High-Order Methods / Methods

    What is Chaining? - Chaining invovles calling multiple methods on the same array/object into a singular expression

### Spread Operator

    What is a Spread Operator? - The spread operator [...] is used to spreaad elements of an interable (arrays or even strings) into new arrays *Clones array*

    1. Used to make a shallow copy of the array.

    2. Used to concatenate Arrays

    3. Used to add elements into an array.

    4. Does not mutate original array.
